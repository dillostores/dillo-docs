# Sensors

The Sensors section allows administrators to view and manage information about the sensors installed in stores. This section includes the following features:

- **Filter Sensors:** The section includes filters to refine the list of sensors based on specific criteria:
  - **Store:** Filter sensors by the store they are associated with.
  - **Type:** Filter sensors by their type. Available types include:
    - **None:** Sensors with no specific type.
    - **Door:** Sensors related to door functionality.
    - **Energy:** Sensors that monitor energy usage.
    - **Temp:** Sensors that measure temperature.
    - **Other:** Sensors that do not fit into the other specified categories.

- **Add Sensor:** Clicking the "Add Sensor" button opens a popup where administrators can enter basic information to add a new sensor. The popup includes fields for the necessary sensor details.

- **Remove Sensor:** Each sensor entry includes a "Remove" button. Clicking this button allows administrators to delete the sensor from the system after confirming the action.

- **View Sensor Information:** Each sensor entry includes an "Info" button. Clicking this button opens a detailed view of the sensor's information, including its type, associated store, and any relevant data it provides.

- **View Sensor Data Tables:** Each sensor entry displays a photo of the sensor. Clicking on this photo allows administrators to view the data tables generated by the sensor, providing insights into the sensor's readings and performance.

These features provide comprehensive management capabilities for sensors, enabling administrators to add, remove, view detailed information, and access sensor-generated data.

## View Sensor Data

To view the information generated by a sensor, follow these steps:

1. **Click on Sensor Image:** Each sensor entry displays a photo of the sensor. Click on this image to navigate to a new page dedicated to the sensor's data.

2. **Access Sensor Data Page:** On the sensor's data page, you will find a "Params" button. Click this button to open a form where you can specify the parameters for retrieving the sensor's data.

3. **Enter Parameters:**
   - **Start (Date):** Enter the start date for the data range you want to view.
   - **End (Date):** Enter the end date for the data range you want to view.
   - **Aggregator:** Choose an aggregator to process the data. Aggregators might include options like average, sum, or other methods of data aggregation.
   - **Bucket Size:** Specify the bucket size, which determines how data is grouped or aggregated over time intervals.

4. **Submit Data:** After filling in the required parameters, click the appropriate button to submit the form and retrieve the sensor data based on the specified criteria.

This process allows administrators to access and analyze detailed sensor data, helping in monitoring and evaluating the performance and readings of the sensors.

## View and Update Status History

To view and update the status history of a sensor, follow these steps:

1. **Click on Info Button:** From the sensor list, click the "Info" button of the sensor for which you want to view the status history. This action opens a detailed view of the sensor's information.

2. **Access Status History:** In the detailed view, locate and click the item labeled "View Status History." This will navigate you to a new page dedicated to the status history of the sensor.

3. **View Status History:** On the status history page, you will see a list of the sensor's status entries, showing the historical status changes.

4. **Update Status:** To change the status, click the "Update Status" button. A form will appear allowing you to select a new status value from the available options.

5. **Select and Confirm New Status:** Choose the desired status value and confirm the update to apply the new status to the sensor.

This process provides an efficient way to monitor and manage the status history of sensors, allowing for quick updates and historical tracking.
